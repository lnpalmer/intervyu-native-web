Before doing anything Android, run 'source android_vars' to set Android SDK environment variables.

For iOS, make sure to open the .xcworkspace instead of the .xcodeproj in ios/.

Take a look at https://github.com/kauffecup/react-native-web-hello-world for an idea of how this works; this setup is based largely on that repository.

package.json contains some helpful scripts (from kauffecup's repo):

For example, 'npm run web-dev' starts the webpack development server on port 8080 with hot reloading.
