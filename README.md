package.json has a few helpful scripts;
for example, npm run web-dev kicks off the web development server on port 8080.

Before doing anything Android, run:

# source android_vars

to set Android SDK environment variables.

This setup is based largely on https://github.com/kauffecup/react-native-web-hello-world.
